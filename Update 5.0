__Hello! Thank you for choosing HoneyComb!__

All of HoneyCombs commands are now only text commands!
Meaning all you have to say is *~h* and HoneyComb will reply 
To your message! Now only a few commands that will need 
HoneyCombs prefix *~*. Commands like *afk,warn,kick,ban,ect*!

I have also fixed a lot of bugs with HoneyComb!
