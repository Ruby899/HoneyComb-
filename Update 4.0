**A message from Mr.L**
There is now a code verification system!  
Just use `~honey set verify code <code>` 
to set a code and `~honey verify <code>` 
to verify useing the code! I have also
 added channel lock and unlock commands 
along with a purge command! I hope the 
google command will come of use!

__THANK YOU FOR USEING HoneyComb!__

much love -Mr.Logan

**just a few commands have been added!
I hope you enjoy them!**
